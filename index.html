Hi there! 
I'm an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh. 
My research and teaching are primarily in **computational sociolinguistics**: 
I study how linguistic differences like the distinction between _working_ and _workin'_ reflect social processes (**sociolinguistics**), and I do so through computational methods like machine learning.
I also work to make linguistics more inclusive and equitable.
