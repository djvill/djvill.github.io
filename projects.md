As a **computational sociolinguist**, my scholarly work sits at the nexus of two research traditions: bringing together computational methods and sociolinguistic perspectives. 
Specifically, my research agenda is organized around three strands:


<ul id="strands">

<li>
Expand the toolkit of sociolinguistic research by making computational techniques and data accessible and usable for other researchers
</li>
<li>
Advance theory in language variation and change by helping to explain how speakers and listeners make sense of the tremendous phonetic variability that characterizes everyday speech
</li>
<li>
Through a combination of ![(1)](assets/img/NYCS-bull-trans-1.svg) and ![(2)](assets/img/NYCS-bull-trans-2.svg), foster a computational sociolinguistics (and a linguistics more broadly) that addresses its research questions faster, better, and more equitably
</li>

</ul>

Below is a sampling of my current and recent-past research projects, with the strand(s) that each project supports.

## Sociolinguistic auto-coding

<!-- BLURB from start of presentations/LabPhon paper -->

<!-- Discuss each paper, but not bullet-point-wise. It's okay to allot different amounts of space to different papers. -->

<!-- I also don't have to go linearly by paper. I could discuss auto-coding performance across papers in one spot, then gradience in another. -->
