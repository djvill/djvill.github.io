# `djvill.github.io`: Dan Villarreal's personal website

This repository powers Dan Villarreal's personal website, <https://djvill.github.io/>.
The website is hosted by GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll.
It is based on Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme.

This document mostly exists as a how-to for Dan.
