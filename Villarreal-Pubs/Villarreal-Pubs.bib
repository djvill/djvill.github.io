	abstract = {This mixed-method study addressed the “foreign TA problem,” reconceptualizing it as the \textit{communication gap}, an issue created by multiple parties—including bias originating from undergraduates. Experimental sessions measured undergraduates’ comprehension of 2 brief lessons taught by an international professor. Between lessons, participants completed 1 of 3 short modules: a bias-stimulation module, a control module, or a linguistic-training module (which confronted both accent misunderstanding and accent bias). While training did not affect comprehension, questionnaire responses revealed a positive effect of training on sociolinguistic attitudes. Follow-up discussion sessions explored undergraduates’ experiences with international faculty and responses to the communication gap. Several important themes emerged from these discussions, including effects on academic plans, negative cognitive effects, and a model of undergraduates’ socialization into accent bias. The article concludes with recommendations specifically geared toward TESOL professionals’ ongoing efforts to close the communication gap, including a greater recognition of undergraduates’ role in perpetuating the gap.},

	abstract = {(First paragraph) Around the world, the forces of globalization are bringing together people, cultures, and ideas in ways that cause us to question conventional wisdom about languages and language policy. It is out of this late modern context that Weber and Horner’s \textit{Introducing Multilingualism: A Social Approach} grows, arguing forcefully for a critical reexamination of core sociolinguistic concepts. The authors waste no time in introducing this critical perspective, seeking to “problematize even such a basic concept as ‘language’” (p. 3) from the outset. The 200 well-written and concise pages that follow present an impressive range of sociolinguistic topics and illustrative examples, never compromising either theoretical depth or real-world grounding. Nor do the authors hesitate to give an honest perspective on modern sociolinguistic issues, showing the dark sides of even well-intentioned policies like the European Union’s “mother tongue + 2,” celebrated developments like the revitalization of Hebrew, and putatively progressive discourses like the discourse of integration in Europe. While it is, on one hand, an impressive work of scholarship, the book is also targeted, as a textbook, toward “undergraduate students and postgraduate students new to studying multilingualism” (back cover); I am concerned that it may realistically be more suitable for students who have already gotten their feet wet with sociolinguistics than those who have not. But its clear presentation of multilingualism and range of useful in-text activities—with some suitable for 20-minute discussions and others for term projects—will no doubt integrate well into the right classroom context},

Twelve intermediate-level Spanish learners interacted with Spanish speakers in oral role-play scenarios designed to elicit different address forms. Learners answered a questionnaire one week later about desired address form use in various interactional scenarios (which were matched with role-play scenarios). An analysis of questionnaire judgments revealed that these learners were both cognizant of the second-order indexical potential of T/V address forms and determined to utilize this indexical potential to construct notions of their desired L2 identities. Conversely, learners’ address-form production exhibited an overgeneralization of T, a result that starkly contrasts with the overgeneralization of V found in previous studies. Whereas some learners failed to consistently produce their desired address forms, compromising their selfconstructed ideal L2 identities, others showed an adeptness at matching their production to their judgments. I thus suggest that future research on L2 pragmatics and L2 identity move beyond a focus on L2 pragmatic competence and toward a consideration of learners’ indexical awareness and agency.},

	title = {The construction of social meaning: {A} matched-guise investigation of the {California} {Vowel} {Shift}},
	abstract = {Research on social meaning, which links language variation to the wider social world, often bases claims about the social meanings of linguistic forms on production (i.e., speakers’ situational use of meaningful forms). In the case of the California Vowel Shift (CVS), an ongoing restructuring of the vowel system of California English that takes place below the level of conscious awareness, previous production research has suggested that the CVS carries social meanings of carefreeness, femininity, and privilege. Left unclear in these production-based claims is whether listeners actually pick up on and recognize the social meanings that speakers apparently utilize the CVS to transmit. In this research, a dialect recognition task with matched guises (California-shifted vs. conservative) forms the basis for exploring Californian listeners’ reactions to the CVS, and how these reactions are mediated by perceptions of dialect geography. In short, this research focuses on listeners’ reactions to the CVS in order to address a more fundamental question: How do listeners and speakers together participate in the construction of social meaning?

Stimuli for the main study task were drawn from excerpts of sociolinguistic interviews with 12 lifelong California English speakers from three regions of the state: the San Francisco Bay Area, Lower Central Valley, and Southern California. Guises were created from interview excerpts by modifying the F2 of each TRAP and GOOSE token via source-filter resynthesis methods. Californian guises featured backed TRAP and fronted GOOSE; conservative guises featured fronted TRAP and backed GOOSE. Ninety-seven Californians participated in a perceptual task in which they attempted to identify speakers’ regional origin and rated speakers on affective scales. The results indicated that Californians recognize the CVS as Californian, as California-shifted guises were less likely to be identified as from outside California (but more likely to be identified as from Southern California). Listeners rated California-shifted guises higher on the scales \textit{Californian}, \textit{sounds like a Valley girl}, and \textit{confident}, indicating a core of social meanings indexed by the CVS. Among listeners from the San Francisco Bay Area, the CVS indexes masculinity, but among Southern California listeners, the CVS indexes femininity. Listeners from across California also rated speakers who they believed to be from the same region as them higher on \textit{Californian}, \textit{familiar}, and \textit{sounds like me}.

This research demonstrates that the social meanings of linguistic forms do not reside only in speakers’ situational use of these forms, as listeners did not associate the CVS with carefreeness, femininity, or privilege, the social meanings of the CVS suggested by previous studies of California English production; instead, I propose an account of the indexical field that links perception and production by placing the core social meanings of the CVS uncovered by this research (Californian identity, sounding like a Valley girl, and confidence) at the center of the CVS’s indexical field. This research also contributes to theory in perceptual dialectology and language change. In order to explain this study’s finding that the CVS is associated with Southern California, this research introduces the perceptual-dialectological process of centrality: the identification of speakers who are believed to most exemplify the speech of a given region. Finally, this research suggests an attitudinal stance that allows changes from below such as the CVS to flourish: speakers are aware of the change in the community (at a tacit level, if not consciously) but do not believe that they are participating in the change.},

The results indicated that listeners associate these features with Californianness, sounding like a Valley girl, and (for male speakers) confidence, complicating the social meanings suggested by production studies.

CSD has been studied since the earliest days of sociolinguistics (e.g., Wolfram 1969; Labov et al. 1968), including in varieties of Chicano English (e.g., Galindo 1987; Santa Ana 1991, 1992, 1996; Bayley 1994a, 1997; Coetzee 2004), and the main constraints on the variable are well documented (Labov 1989; Schreier 2005; Hazen 2011). Precisely because CSD has been so widely studied, examination of this variable enables us to compare constraint effects between well-documented varieties and varieties that have received less attention (cf. Wolfram, Childs, and Torbert 2000; Torbert 2001; Hazen 2011). Moreover, previous studies in Latino communities have focused on urban populations in New York, Austin, San Antonio, and Los Angeles. By contrast, this study examines this variable in the very different conditions of a rural community where Mexican Americans comprise more than 85 percent of the population, while Anglos comprise only 10 percent (for background on North Town, see Foley 1990, and Chapter 2, this volume). Although CSD has been very extensively studied, this classic variable continues to serve as a useful diagnostic for examining dialect differences, particularly in dialects where language contact is involved. This study provides a look into the situation of CSD in dialect contact in a rural majority minority community and compares the results for this well-studied variable with studies conducted among Mexican Americans in urban areas and with speakers of other contact varieties of English.},

Eleven phonetically trained listeners judged 60 classifier-coded tokens as Present or Absent. Judgment results indicated a significant positive linear relationship between classifier probability and human judgments; classifier probability also outperformed individual acoustic measures (e.g., F3 minimum) in predicting human judgments.

In particular, this task tested whether judgments of President Barack Obama as sounding ‘more’ or ‘less’ black (e.g., Alim \& Smitherman, 2012) are sensitive to differences in intonation. Half of critical stimuli featured an L+H* pitch accent, which occurs more frequently in African American Language than in Mainstream U.S. English (Holliday, 2016). Four stimuli apiece were created from these phrases by making each pitch accent more extreme by semitonebased F0 steps. Seventy-nine listeners rated these stimuli via the question, “How black does Obama sound here?” Mixed-effects modeling indicated that listeners rated more phonetically extreme L+H* stimuli as sounding blacker, regardless of listener identity. A post-hoc analysis found that listeners attended to different voice quality features in L+H* stimuli. We discuss implications for research in intonation, ethnic identification, incrementality, language attitudes, and sociolinguistic awareness.},

In this paper, we apply a machine learning method, random forest classification (Breiman, 2001), to automate coding (categorical prediction) of two English sociophonetic variables traditionally treated as categorical, non-prevocalic /r/ and word-medial intervocalic /t/, based on tokens’ acoustic signatures. We found good performance for binary classifiers of non-prevocalic /r/ (Absent versus Present) and medial /t/ (Voiced versus Voiceless), but not for medial /t/ with a six-way coding distinction (largely due to some codes being sparsely represented in the training data). This method also yields rankings of acoustic measures in terms of importance in classification. Beyond any individual measures, this method generates probabilistic predictions of variation (classifier probabilities) that represent a composite of the acoustic cues fed into the model. In a listening experiment, we found that not only did classifier probabilities significantly capture gradience in trained listeners’ perceptions of rhoticity, they better predicted listeners’ perceptions than individual acoustic measures. This method thus represents a new approach to reconciling the categorical and continuous dimensions of sociophonetic variation.},

Thirty-five college students heard matched-guise stimuli differing only by trap F2, guessed speakers’ regional origin, and rated speakers on 14 affective scales. Listeners associated trap backing with California (despite local participation in the sound shift) and general prestige. The authors suggest that this association with general prestige may help to explain the presence of this vowel shift in Kansas despite considerable ideological differences with California. They argue that these results highlight the interaction between local construction of meaning and broader national discourses for a sound change: while stereotypical associations with a sound change can spread rapidly through means like popular media, stance and identity associations are constructed at the local level.},

The present paper investigates whether priming effects manifest in continuous phonetic variation the way it has been reported in phonological, morphological, and syntactic variation. We analyzed nearly 60,000 tokens of vowels involved in the New Zealand English short front vowel shift (SFVS), a change in progress in which trap/dress move in the opposite direction to kit, from a topic-controlled corpus of monologues (166 speakers), to test for effects that are characteristic of priming phenomena: repetition, decay, and lexical boost. Our analysis found evidence for all three effects. Tokens that were relatively high and front tended to be followed by tokens that were also high and front; the repetition effect weakened with greater time between the prime and target; and the repetition effect was stronger if the prime and target belonged to (different tokens of) the same word. Contrary to our expectations, however, the cross-vowel effects suggest that the repetition effect responded not to the direction of vowel changes within the SFVS, but rather the peripherality of the tokens. We also found an interaction between priming behavior and gender, with stronger repetition effects among men than women. While these findings both indicate that priming manifests in continuous phonetic variation and provide further evidence that priming is among the factors providing structure to intraspeaker variation, they also challenge unitary accounts of priming phenomena.},

These results may be a product of a particular set of sociohistorical facts thatare not peculiar to Southland.

	abstract = {Open Methods are resources that pertain to at least one stage in the linguistics research process and are available free of charge to all who can find them (e.g., Boersma \& Weenink 2021; Kendall \& Farrington 2020; Styler 2021). We describe the current state of Open Methods in linguistics, including benefits and structural barriers to further development. Then, in the spirit of "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it", we discuss how Open Access (a longer-developed cousin to Open Methods that focuses on publishing research) fails to adequately serve research(ers) in the global context despite its agreeable basic premise (Meagher 2021). We critically assess whether Open Methods can help decolonize linguistics research—or whether it merely allows already-privileged linguistics to accrue greater privilege. We ultimately present a cautiously optimistic model for anticolonial Open Methods in linguistics, with recommendations and examples of practices and policies throughout.},

	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/6546894},
	abstract = {In order for Open Methods to mitigate resource barriers to linguistics research, the Open Methods themselves must not act as or require substantial resource barriers to access and use. We emphasize "substantial" here because there is no such thing as an absence of resource barriers; just because Open Method is freely available online doesn't make it accessible to everyone. To evaluate this aspect of Open Methods, we build on similar widely-used tools in the Open Access space to create a "Spectrum of Open Methods". This tool is not meant to gatekeep open methods; a method that's imperfect but published is always more open than a method that never gets published because it's not perfect yet. Rather, the Spectrum of Open Methods is intended to inspire creators to make adjustments to their resources to make them as open as possible. To illustrate, a Case Study is included where Dan Villarreal has deployed the Spectrum of Open Methods to one of his projects and identified avenues for future development and improvement. We developed this tool while working on a chapter titled "Open Methods: Decolonizing (or not) research methods in linguistics" for the forthcoming volume Decolonizing Linguistics edited by Anne Charity Hudley, Christine Mallinson, and Mary Bucholtz and published by Oxford University Press. We welcome iterations of this Spectrum of Open Methods with edits, adaptations to other fields, or discipline-specific adjustments.},

	title = {Sociolinguistic auto-coding has fairness problems too: {Measuring} and mitigating bias.},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Sociolinguistics researchers can use sociolinguistic auto-coding (SLAC) to predict humans’ hand-codes of sociolinguistic data. While auto-coding promises opportunities for greater efficiency, like other computational methods there are inherent concerns about this method’s \textit{fairness}—whether it generates equally valid predictions for different speaker groups. This would be problematic for sociolinguistic work given the central importance of correlating speaker groups to differences in variable usage. The current study examines SLAC fairness through the lens of gender fairness in auto-coding Southland New Zealand English prevocalic /r/. First, given that there are multiple, mutually incompatible definitions of ML fairness, I argue that fairness for SLAC is best captured by two fairness definitions, overall accuracy equality and class accuracy equality, corresponding to three fairness metrics. Second, I empirically assess the extent to which SLAC is prone to unfairness. I find that a specific auto-coder reported on in previous literature performed poorly on all three fairness metrics. Third, to remedy these imbalances, I tested unfairness mitigation strategies on the same data. I find several strategies that reduced unfairness to virtually zero. I close by discussing what SLAC fairness means not just for auto-coding, but more broadly for how we conceptualize variation as an object of study.},
